# AI-Based RTL Timing Prediction 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses **Machine Learning (Random Forest & XGBoost)** to predict **combinational logic depth** in RTL designs, helping detect **timing violations early**.  
By estimating the logic depth **before synthesis**, this model helps **VLSI engineers and RTL designers** optimize their circuits and avoid expensive **re-design iterations**.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Predicts **combinational depth** before synthesis  
✅ Uses **Fan-In, Fan-Out, Gate Count** as features  
✅ Supports **Random Forest (fast) & XGBoost (accurate)**  
✅ **Saves hours of design time** by avoiding full synthesis runs
